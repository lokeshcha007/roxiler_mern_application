# roxiler_mern_application
#Project Overview
#This project involves creating a system to manage and analyze product transactions. It consists of two main parts:

#Backend: A server-side application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It fetches product transaction data from a #third-party API, stores it in a database, and provides several APIs to access and analyze this data.
#Frontend: A client-side application that interacts with the backend to display transaction data in a user-friendly way. It includes #features like tables and charts to visualize the data.
#Key Features
#Backend
#Database Initialization: Fetches data from a third-party source and saves it in a local database.
#List Transactions: Provides a way to list all transactions, with options to search and paginate the results.
#Statistics: Generates statistics about sales, like total sale amount and number of sold/not sold items.
#Bar Chart: Creates data for a bar chart showing the distribution of product prices.
#Pie Chart: Generates data for a pie chart showing the distribution of product categories.
#Combined Data: Fetches and combines data from multiple sources to give a comprehensive view.
#Frontend
#Transactions Table: Shows a list of transactions with options to filter by month and search by product details.
Month Selection: Allows users to select a month to view relevant transactions.
Search: Provides a search box to filter transactions based on title, description, or price.
Pagination: Supports navigating through multiple pages of transactions.
Statistics Display: Shows key statistics like total sales and number of sold/not sold items for the selected month.
Bar Chart: Displays a bar chart of product price ranges for the selected month.
Pie Chart: Shows a pie chart of product categories and their counts for the selected month.
